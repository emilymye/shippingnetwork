*********************************************************************************************
Class ShippingNetwork maintains general information of the system, including the information
needed by Statistics entity type.

Classes with "Rep" in name are rep layer objects.

Classes including Location, Terminal, Segment, Fleet and their subclasses are engine layer
objects.

The rep layer serves as a middle layer interface. When creating instances, rep layer objects
are created first, from which the actual engine layer objects are then created. The rep layer
also passes requests including attribute read/write, and deleting instances down to the engine
layer.
